/**
 * A re-openable, fully-duplex, socket-like object that connects to an MPI device.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code Connector} abstracts the network & data link part of connecting to a Miura device.
 * This allows the Miura SDK to talk (using MPI) over a byte stream to the device
 * without worrying about the physical or platform specific way of connecting to it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To allow the SDK to connect to a Miura Device
 * integrators need to {@code extend Connector} and implement the abstract methods to
 * provide the functionality required by their platform and chosen connection type.
 * The {@code Connector} is then passed by the app to the main SDK classes,
 * (i.e. {@link MiuraManager} and {@link MpiClient}),
 * which use the Connector-wrapped-link to open a byte stream and talk to a Miura device.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Contract</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Unlike, e.g. {@link java.net.Socket}, a Connector is considered 're-openeable'.
 * In other words, a Connector can be opened and closed as many times as the SDK requires.
 * Integrating applications needs to be aware of this and act accordingly when managing their
 * resources.
 * {@link #connect()} will never been called twice in succession without calling
 * {@link #disconnect(MpiProtocolSession)} between them. {@link #disconnect(MpiProtocolSession)},
 * however, can be called whenever
 * the SDK likes and can be called multiple times in a row, so it should be idempotent if possible.
 * e.g. {@link ClientSocketConnector} has to create and destroy {@link java.net.Socket} objects
 * as appropriate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Open a Connector is "connected" a session is opened on the data streams
 * (see {@link MpiProtocolSession}). The MpiProtocolSession is responsible for
 * sending data over the streams.
 * Integrator's applications should not send <b>any data</b>
 * down the data link that a Connector object is wrapping
 * (even before that data link is wrapping in a Connector!),
 * as the other end will be a
 * Miura device expecting to communicate via the MPI protocol,
 * which is the responsibility of the Miura SDK.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Integrators's classes extending Connectors <b>should not</b> call any of the non-abstract
 * methods that are part of the abstract class, including {@link #closeSession()}.
 * Just close the underlying stream resources. The SDK will "find out" and call closeSession
 * itself.
 * <br />
 * Integrator's other classes should not call <b>any</b> methods on a Connector,
 * except perhaps {@link #isConnected()}.
 * The SDK is responsible for calling the methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An extending class also needs to take care of the exceptions throw by their
 * wrapped resources and translate them into what Connector expects.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h3> Notes </h3>
 *
 * <p>Some common and platform-agnostic Connector's
 * are already available in the SDK comms package, and other examples
 * are available in the SDK tests and the App. e.g. {@link ClientSocketConnector}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Connector is an abstract class rather than an interface as the final methods present
 * set behaviour the SDK would like to perform on all Connectors. The SDk also targets Java < 8
 * so 'default' methods can't be used.
 * </p>
