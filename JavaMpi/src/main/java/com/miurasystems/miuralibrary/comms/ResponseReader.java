/**
 * 'Generator' style class that yields ResponseMessages from a stream
 *
 * <p> Exists because the MPI protocol technically allows packets from
 * different NADs to interleave. It's highly unlikely to happen, but
 * it's possible.
 *
 * <p> e.g. MPI is sending back a large solicited chain of packets and
 * RPI also wants to send an unsolicited message at the same time.
 * The message from RPI might appear "in the middle" of the MPI
 * chain (or some other kind of "interleaved" configuration if
 * the RPI one is chained)
 *
 * <p> It also exists because Java doesn't have generators/co-routines/yield
 * and the streaming stuff is Java 8 only, which targeted versions of
 * Android don't have.
 *
 * <p> ResponseReader is a stateful object, and one needs to exist to
 * read ResponseMessages from a stream. Call {@link #nextResponse()}
 * to get the next available Response. nextResponse will keep
 * returning messages until it hits an error of some kind. Once it
 * does hit an error it will always return null and the entire
 * ResponseReader is considered "broken". You must make a new
 * one if you wish to use the class to read from the Stream.
 * (and most likely you'll want to disconnect/reconnect to MPI
 * before making a new ResponseReader)
