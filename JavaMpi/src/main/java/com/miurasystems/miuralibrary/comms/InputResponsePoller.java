/**
 * An InputResponsePoller will continually read ResponseMessages from an
 * ResponseReader and will post solicited message to the given queues and
 * unsolicited messages to the given callback.
 *
 * <p> InputResponsePoller supports message per-NAD. Messages are posted to
 * the queue matching their NAD.
 *
 * <p> The class is a Runnable and intended to be run in a separate thread
 * from the class(es) reading the other end of the message queues. The idea is
 * that the blocking {@code .read()} calls happen in InputResponsePoller,
 * so the client isn't stuck waiting around for data until it actually needs
 * it, and then it can wait on the other end of the message queues.
 *
 * <p>It is intended to only be run once. (i.e. Thread.start() is only called
 * once)
 *
 * <p>An InputResponsePoller will run forever until:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The underlying InputStream closes, reaches EOF, or produces data such that
 * {@link ResponseReader#nextResponse()} returns null. See
 * {@link PollerStatus#StoppedStreamBroken})
 * </li>
 * <li>Any queue becomes full and cannot be posted to in the timeout period.
 * See {@link PollerStatus#StoppedQueuePostTimedOut}) and
 * {@link BlockingQueue#offer(Object, long, TimeUnit)}</li>
 * <li>The thread is interrupted whilst trying to post to any queue (See
 * {@link PollerStatus#StoppedQueuePostInterrupted})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Before stopping the InputResponsePoller will post
 * terminal message to all queues. See {@link PollerMessage} for more.
 *
 * <p> As such there's no direct mechanism to stop this thread running other
 * than those conditions, but in all cases those conditions are able to be
 * enacted by the constructor of the {@code InputResponsePoller} object.
 * (i.e. it has the power and responsibility to close the InputStream,
 * or stop reading from the queues)
 *
 * <p> Note: It's implemented this way because there's no need to stop an
 * InputResponsePoller until the InputStream/ResponseReader is closed.
 * All data on that InputStream should be a valid ResponseMessages
 * that can be read by {@code InputResponsePoller}.
 * And if the InputStream is closing for whatever reason then the
 * {@code InputResponsePoller} will also want closing as well.
 *
 * <p> It's also because the Android bluetooth implementation is pretty
 * poor and there's no timeout facility when reading a bluetooth sockets
 * in the Android API, even though that functionality exists at lower
 * levels of the Android implementation.
 * There's also no way to kill a tread blocked by a
 * {@link InputStream#read()}, so even <i>if</i> an external thread
 * wanted to kill an {@code InputResponsePoller} that was stuck in a
 * {@code read()} they couldn't! They'd have to .close the stream
 * anyway to avoid the zombie thread.
 *
 * <p> So closing the stream, which closes the ResponseReader,
 * is <b>the</b> way to signal to
 * an InputResponsePoller that you want it to stop.
 *
 * <p> The canonical procedure is:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Close the InputStream / break the ResponseReader. </li>
 * <li>Wait a short time, e.g. 5 ms</li>
 * <li>Call {@link Thread#interrupt()} on the thread running the
 * InputResponsePoller, in-case it's waiting whilst posting to
 * a message queue
 * </li>
 * <li>Await the status callback to confirm it dies</li>
 * </ol>

                Timing out when posting a terminal message is pretty extreme.
                It's a good idea to try and insert the sentinel, so try again with a
                massive timeout.

                Why not just use a massive timeout in the first place?

                Because ordinarily the fast timeout should be ok, and if it isn't then the app
                should be exposed to dire errors in the log so they know to fix it and actually
                read the queue before it fills up!

                (The usual use case is no more than one outstanding solicited message and
                 the app is expecting it, so the wait should be practically instant.)
            */
