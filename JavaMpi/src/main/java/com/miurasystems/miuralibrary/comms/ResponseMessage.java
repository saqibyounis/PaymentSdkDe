/**
 * Represents a Response Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) from a Miura Device, based on
 * the MPI API doc and also vaguely based on ISO-7816-3. This response APDU is the concatenation of
 * the "information fields" in a {@link MpiPacket response packet(s)}.
 *
 * A response may be 'solicited' or not. A solicited response is sent in response to a command.
 * An unsolicited response is sent whenever the device likes.
 *
 * A response contains any information sent from the Miura device as the 'body', and also has
 * a status code that says whether a command succeed or not. (In the case of an unsolicited
 * response, the status code means whatever the MPI API defines it to mean)
 *
 * The contents and format of the body are entirely dependent on the command that is being
 * responded to and are therefore treated as bytes by ResponseMessage. It's up to the code reading
 * the response to interpret those bytes correctly.
 *
 * Responses are sent from the Miura device in a packetised form (see {@link MpiPacket}) and
 * a single response can be split over multiple packets. Therefore responses should be
 * read from a bytestream by a {@link ResponseReader} rather than being constructed directly.
