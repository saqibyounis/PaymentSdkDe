/**
 * MpiEvents is a collection of {@link MpiEventPublisher}s.
 *
 * <p>
 * It has one publisher instance for each "event" that the SDK can emit.
 * MpiEventPublisher is a simple implementation of the observable pattern.
 * An app will register listeners on the events they care about by calling
 * {@code MpiEventPublisher.register(eventListener)}.
 * Event listeners <i>can</i> be anonymous, but it's
 * not recommended to do so, otherwise they can't be deregistered.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each MpiEventPublisher in the group shares a mutex. Only one publisher from
 * the group can be executing code at anyone time, meaning only one callback
 * will be active at once.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each client will have a single event collection to notify events on.
 * An MpiEvents can be shared between multiple MpiClients/MiuraManager if desired
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Events are not "queued up" in anyway. If there is no registered listener at the time
 * of event dispatch then the event is simply discarded. Put another way:
 * If a Miura device emits an event and there's no one around to hear it, then it wasn't an event.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Opening a session will trigger the {@link #Connected} event. Some events,
 * e.g. {@link #DeviceStatusChanged}, are activate as soon as a session begins,
 * so it's best to subscribe to these events <b>before</b> opening a session otherwise they
 * will be discarded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To prevent race conditions and other problems when receiving unsolicited events from the device,
 * the SDK has a few rules in place about the use of events:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The SDK can call events listeners from different threads.
 * Importantly, the SDK might call an event from its InputStream reading thread.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * As such <b>a minimum amount of code as possible should be executed by an event listener</b>.
 * The more code executed in an event listener,
 * the less responsive the input reader thread will be.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Using of the synchronous interface (MpiClient) from an event listener will probably cause a
 * deadlock, as the InputStream reader will be waiting to receive a message from a queue
 * that it should have posted it.
 * </li>
 * <li> Use of the asynchronous interface (MiuraManager) from a listener is fine</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li> There can be only one registered listener for each event at a time.</li>
 * <li> The SDK will only ever call one event listener in an MpiEvents collection at a time.
 * <ul>
 * <li> It will never call them concurrently. </li>
 * <li> An event shouldn't call notify from a listener. (Whilst an app does not have
 * the correct visibility to call notify, it can end up doing so by calling a method on
 * MpiEvents that results in e.g. a Disconnect.)
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li> As the SDK will only call one event at once it's possible for other events to be "waiting"
 * </li>
 * <li> A listener may register/de-register itself and other listeners without any problems.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * This has a <i>happens-before</i> relationship with the next event to be called.
 * (In general register/deregister has a <i>happens-before</i> relationship to event calling,
 * whether those methods are called from a listener or normal code).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li> A listener <i>might</i> be called once deregistered.</li>
 * <li> Exceptions will not be caught</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This may seem like a lot of rules, but the general rule is "keep event listeners small"
 * and "don't directly call MpiEvents methods from a listener".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As the event listeners are expected to contain a small amount of code it is expected that apps
 * have a system in place to handle these events properly and schedule any large work they wish to
 * perform after an event happens on the appropriate worker thread.
